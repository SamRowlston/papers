# Title
Model-measurement comparison of BBOA over West Africa

#Authors
Gerard Capes
John Smith

#Introduction

We have to acknowledge previous work, so as not to appear full of ourselves. 

We used an AMS (Allen et al. 2004) to measure particle composition

Ground based measurements of BBOA have been made by J Smith et al.

# Simulations

John's box model simulations supports the hypothesis that coagulation is driving pareticle growth

#Methodology

Particle size distributions were measured using a TSI SMPS (Bloggs et al 2007)
